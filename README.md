# Learning-CSharp-.NET
A repository for learning and exploring C# and .NET, with code samples, exercises, and project experiments.

> 💡 Most project executables are located in the `bin/Debug` folder.  
> If you just want to run the app and try it out, you can launch the `.exe` from there.

> 🛠️ For editing the code, you’ll likely need **Visual Studio** (not VS Code),  
> and just open the `.sln` (solution) file to get started.
